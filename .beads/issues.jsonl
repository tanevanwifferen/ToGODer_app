{"id":"ta-5hr","title":"Fix startup routing: navigate to chat after first launch","description":"dispatched_by: mayor\n\n## Problem\nOn first app launch, user sees ChatList instead of being taken to their new chat.\n\n## Root Cause\nRace condition between two initialization paths:\n\n1. `useInitialization.ts:50-57` - On first launch, creates a chat and sets it as current, but doesn't navigate to `/chat/[id]`\n\n2. `index.tsx:14-26` - Checks `if (chats.length === 0)` to create and navigate, but by this point useInitialization already created a chat, so `chats.length === 1` and navigation never happens\n\n## Fix\nIn `hooks/useInitialization.ts`, after creating the chat on first launch (line 57), add navigation:\n\n```typescript\nimport { router } from 'expo-router';\n// ...\nrouter.push({ pathname: '/chat/[id]', params: { id: newChatId } });\n```\n\n## Files\n- `hooks/useInitialization.ts` - Add router navigation after chat creation\n- `app/(drawer)/index.tsx` - May need cleanup of redundant chat creation logic","status":"hooked","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"togoder_app/polecats/furiosa","owner":"tanevanwifferen@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:04:27.030756+01:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-14T22:07:34.943238+01:00"}
